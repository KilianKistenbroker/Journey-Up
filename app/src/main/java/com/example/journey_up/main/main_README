This package is going to store the lower level logic for the purpose of dynamic scaling
across multiple mobile devices.

Things like dynamic rendering, proper memory management, proper threading will be
implemented here. This package will also include other functions that are more specific
to the game, like a 'Camera' class to imitate player movement, or a 'SceneManager' to
manage what scene the user is in (e.g. main menu, pause menu, level 1, etc.).
