This package is going to store the lower level logic for the purpose of dynamic scaling
across multiple mobile devices.

Things like dynamic rendering, proper memory management, proper threading will be
implemented here. This package will also include other functions that are more specific
to the game, like a 'Camera' class to imitate player movement, or a 'SceneManager' to
manage what scene the user is in (e.g. main menu, pause menu, level 1, etc.).

threads will involve the following:
    1. draw(): this will draw all objects on screen.
    2. search(): this will be an in-game collision detection algorithm, which runs a binary
        searches for player-object collision. This must be synced with draw() to avoid race
        conditions.
    3. timer(): runs an internal clock to track total time played on the app. This thread will
        also have child threads for running in-game timers.
    4. sort(): this will be used during loading screens to sort ObjectManger array of objects
        depending on their x and y coordinates.
