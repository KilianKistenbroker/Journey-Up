This package is going to store the 'Level' classes.

The 'Level' class is where we build the objects to be displayed on screen
for the user to interact with. To do this, I will call manager classes to
create the objects.

will likely create one dynamic 'ObjectManager' class to store all objects into a single
ArrayList. 'ObjectManager' will be in charge of the sorting and searching of objects
for player-object collision detection. 'Objects' will decide what to do if a player
collides with it.

Here is a basic look at the structure of a level, where draw() and search() will run
in parallel.

ex: Class Level
    {
        ObjectManager<T> object = new ObjectManager<T> (
        int left, int top, int right, int bottom);

        draw(Canvas canvas)
        {
            ObjectManager.draw(canvas);
        }

        search()
        {
            ObjectManager.search();
        }
    }

T will determine the type of object to be created, defined in 'objects' package, and the
parameters will specify where to put the object on the screen.
