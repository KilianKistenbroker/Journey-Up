# Journey-Up
This is a demo of a 2-D platforming game being made with Android Studio 
for mobile devices.

The purpose of this project is to display my knowledge of data structures,
programming methodologies, operating system principles, and algorithms using
the Java programming language.

My code is in app-> src-> main-> java/com/example/journey_up. Please check the
README files of the respective packages for a basic understanding of how the
classes will interact with each other.

This project isn't intended for commercial use, so feel free to use whatever you
find useful.
