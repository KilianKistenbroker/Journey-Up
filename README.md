# Journey-Up
This is a demo of a 2-D platforming game being made with Android Studio 
for mobile devices.

The purpose of this project is to display knowledge of data structures,
programming methodologies, operating system principles, and algorithms 
using Java.

My code is in app-> src-> main-> java/com/example/journey_up. Please check the
README files inside the respective packages for a better understanding of how 
the classes will interact with each other.

A brief description of a java file will also be at the header.
